# Introductory Steps
## Step 1: Specify the main design challenge
### What is the main activity your project would support the users' needs?
> #### This project will support users in their search of food recipes and enhancement of conveninet cooking process. This project will provide me a better understanding of user's expectation toward the food recipe service. Providing a better way to find relevant and easier food recipe and options will allow many others to gain interest in cooking during this unpleasant time, when restaurant dining is prohibited or limited. This can lead many people to build up their new hobby, "cooking". Having more conveninent and handy way to find food recipes or cooking, will make cooking fun. The main activity of easy use of the app (without certain level of expertise in technology) and the following support of ingredient delivery service will relieve ease of many individual's pain having to always think and search for healthy balanced recipes. 
### What is the basic need involved for that activity?
> #### this activity fulfills the users' basic need for safety. The easy to follow directions and the careful nutrition measurement will support the users' health with a balanced diet. Going to restaurants to eat can cause insecurity during this pandemic. Therefore, it will be more safe and relieved to cook the food from home with easy-to-follow recipes. For further asisstance, it will provide a ingredient delivery service that will safely bring the needed ingredients you one's home. There would be no need for an individual to go to market and shop for their ingredients. Rather, this app will allows people to look for the desired ingredients and shop the exact ingredients from nearest grocery strores. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solutions(s) to satisfy the needs?
> #### Current solutions might satisfy these needs in other "cooking recipe apps/ websites" to certain aspects. However, my demographics of "middle-aged women" might find the currently existing apps or websites quite hard to use. Most of the websites/ apps were somewhat difficult to use or did not follow the "consistency and stardard" format. Although most middle-aged women were not familiar with the hidden functions, it seemed very tricky or difficult to use the app/web. It is also more likely them for them to actually go to grocery shopping rather than simply odering the items from online through other possible services (ex. Amazon fresh). This app will allow easy access to the users and make their cooking process conveninet as possible. 
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
> #### Many of the apps/web does not support direction that allows the users to fully utilize the app, unless they look for support page. Adding an introductory guide function when an user first launches the app will be very helpful to find the precise function that they are seeking. Simple and organized categorical design should be carefully examined to utilize the full potential of the app. Also, the format should definitely be alinged with the standard (consistency and standard in heuristic evaluation). The app should not be just overwhelmed with whole chunk of information, but should be well-organized and listed throughout the usage.

### Step 2: Target Users
#### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
> #### Demographics: middle-aged women, mostly working mom, familiar with cooking, may not be a tech-saavy,live in the United States
> #### Preference: Users are very familiar with cooking, looking for new and healthy recipes. 
> #### Expertise: Do not need any level of expertise to use this app.
#### Where would the users do that activity?
> #### Users would use this app anywhere. It will allow the users to find the relevant food recipes that they are looking for. Also, it will list nearest grocery stores that currently have the ingredients. The users can pick out the desired recipe on their way to home, a day before, or at home because the items will be easy delivered to their home. There would be two options which will allow the user to pick up their ingredients from the nearest grocery market, or have them delivered to their doors. 
#### What would the users do to complete that activity?
> #### Users will search for a recipe that they are willing to cook. If they are missing some or all ingredients, they will pick another menu or are likely to go to the grocery store to shop their missing ingredients.

### Step 3: Pick Research Methods
### I chose to conduct an ethnographic research and quick-survey for the research methods.
> #### Ethnographic research was conducted in Trader Joe's in Los Angeles ( 263 South La Brea Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90036). 
> #### The line was formed and the number of people entering the store was managed by the staff. They checked and made sure eveyone was wearing a mask and offered hand sanitizer on their entering. I observed people in the market during their shop. Everyone seemed to have their masks on, or their entrance was prohibited in the venue. I saw a lot of people wearing masks, gloves, sunglasses, or even face shields. People seemed to avoid the crowded areas or waited far from the shopper to get a product. The line was comparably longer to maintain social distancing. The cashiers were constantly sanitizing the POS and credit card readers during every encounter. After people came out from the grocety store, a number of people were sanitizing their hands from the sanitizing stations.

### Step 4: Plan to get into the context & Write down the observation
#### Decide where to visit:
> #### Trader Joes in Los Angeles (263 South La Brea Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90036).
#### Decide what activities to observe: 
> #### I decided to observe the shopping process of the people. How the pandemic seem to delay the shopping process and what rules that people had to follow. 
> #### I mostly observed middle aged women in the store and how shopping during pandemic can cause delay and difficulty.
> #### I collected the user date with pen-paper notes; quick survey.
# 

### Step 5: Conduct the research:
### Visited the place: Trader joe's. (waited in the line and went in the store and observed)
> #### I observed the shoppers in the store (mostly middle-aged womens) and asked them for their participation for a quick-survey.
> #### I've collected the data through answered_survey and the notes that I've taken during my observation.
> #### link to the survey: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lC-oQlxWPDIASJZbK6y3iOQLFuDFShaplH59tNFj7wo/edit?usp=sharing

### Step 6: Reflection
> #### I found this contectual inquiry very interesting helpful. It gave me chance to realize what seems to be needed for better design structure of the program. I was very thankful that number of people actually allowed their time to participate in the survey that I've requested. It gave me more confidence of the subject when I was able to collect the ideas of participants. The concept of the app was not informed, so I will be add the feedbacks and answers to development of the app. It was a face-pace enviornment, so I was not able to gather as much of information and had to design the survey very short. It would have been more helpful if I had time to ask for more in-dept questions. I will use this survey as a reference to build up on my hypothesis of the app design. However, I was able to learn that the pandemic had its impact on people's cooking. They seem to go to grocery stores at least once every week and seemed to spend more time on cooking. It was clear that safety regulations did cause pain to the people, not being able to easily dine in and rather having to cook. People often seemed not to fully trust the online grocery shopping method or was not really familiar with the system. They all used and preferred online or web cooking recipes more than cook books.
